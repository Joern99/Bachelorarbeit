	abstract = {In 2016, medulloblastoma classification was restructured to allow for incorporation of updated data about medulloblastoma biology, genomics, and clinical behavior. For the first time, medulloblastomas were classified according to molecular characteristics ("genetically defined" categories) as well as histologic characteristics ("histologically defined" categories). Current genetically-defined categories include {WNT}-activated, {SHH}-activated {TP}53 wildtype, {SHH}-activated {TP}53-mutant, and non-{WNT}/non-{SHH}. In this article, we review the most recent update to the classification of medulloblastomas, provide a practical approach to immunohistochemical and molecular testing for these tumors, and demonstrate how to use key molecular genetic findings to develop an integrated diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent orconvolutional neural networks in an encoder and decoder configuration. The best performing such models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attentionm echanisms.  We propose a novel, simple network architecture based solely onan attention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superiorin quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less timeto train. Our single model with 165 million parameters, achieves 27.5 {BLEU} {onEnglish}-to-German translation, improving over the existing best ensemble result by over 1 {BLEU}. On English-to-French translation, we outperform the previoussingle state-of-the-art with model by 0.7 {BLEU}, achieving a {BLEU} score of 41.1.},
